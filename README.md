Dear reader,

I, Kale Miller, have created a script in Python to complete basic tasks
that often have to be done for Windows Client workstations in the 
Cyber Patrio cyber defense competitions.  This script will first be 
used in CPIX. I believe it is against the rules for anyone to use this
script in competitions, but you can use my code for ideas or help :)
